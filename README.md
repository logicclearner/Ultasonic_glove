# Ultasonic_glove
This project is an Arduino-based smart glove that functions as a proximity sensor to help users detect obstacles. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance to nearby objects and provides variable auditory feedback through a buzzer, making it a useful accessibility tool. The closer an object is, the faster the buzzer will beep.
